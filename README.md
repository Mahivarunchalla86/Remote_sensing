"Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Cadastral Maps. This project develops an OCR model to extract characters &amp; numbers from cadastral maps, enabling digitization &amp; integration with geospatial systems. Applications include land ownership verification, property tax databases, &amp; spatial decision support systems."
Project Overview

This project aims to develop an OCR-based model for detecting and extracting characters and numbers from cadastral maps. The goal is to convert legacy documents into digital formats, enabling integration with modern geospatial systems and supporting applications such as land ownership verification, property tax databases, and spatial decision support systems.

Objectives

The main aim of this task is to extract all possible characters and numbers from cadastral maps, which involves several tasks:

1. Preprocessing of Cadastral Map Images: Enhance image quality and remove noise
2. Text and Number Region Detection: Identify regions containing text and numbers
3. Character and Number Segmentation: Segment individual characters and numbers from detected regions
4. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Recognize segmented characters and numbers
5. Post-processing: Clean and format extracted data for output

Methodology

The project will employ a combination of image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques to achieve the objectives.

Expected Output

- An Excel sheet or CSV file containing extracted characters and numbers from cadastral maps

Applications

- Land ownership verification
- Property tax databases
- Spatial decision support systems
- Mobile land survey tools
- Smart urban planning
- Disaster relief management
- Agriculture monitoring

Project Structure

- data/: Sample input images and output CSV/Excel files
- src/: Source code for the OCR model
- models/: Trained OCR models and weights
- requirements.txt: Dependencies and libraries required to run the project
